# Methodology for Relating Grocery Store Data with Proximity to Open Spaces

## Related Datasets
1. **Grocery Store Locations:** Extracted from OpenStreetMap using Overpass Turbo.
2. **Open Spaces (Parks) Data:** Obtained from NYC Open Data or another reliable source.

## Steps and Workflow

1. **Identify Points of Interest:**
   - Use the GeoJSON file containing grocery stores around your locality.
   - Download the parks dataset, which contains the locations and boundaries of parks and open spaces.

2. **Load Datasets:**
   - Load both the grocery stores dataset and the parks dataset into QGIS or another GIS software.

3. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure both datasets are in the same coordinate reference system (CRS).
   - Clean the datasets by removing any unnecessary attributes or correcting any inconsistencies.

4. **Proximity Analysis:**
   - Use a proximity analysis tool to measure the distance between each grocery store and the nearest park.
   - This can be done using the "Nearest Neighbor" analysis in QGIS or similar tools in other GIS software.

5. **Buffer Analysis:**
   - Create buffer zones around each park to visualize areas within a certain distance (e.g., 500 meters, 1 kilometer).
   - Overlay the grocery store locations on these buffer zones to see which stores fall within the specified distances.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Create a map that shows grocery stores, parks, and the buffer zones.
   - Use different colors or symbols to differentiate between grocery stores that are within a certain proximity to parks and those that are not.

7. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Calculate statistics such as the number of grocery stores within each buffer zone, the average distance from grocery stores to the nearest park, etc.
   - Use these statistics to understand the spatial relationship between grocery stores and parks.

8. **Derive Insights:**
   - Analyze the results to identify patterns or trends. For example, are grocery stores generally located near parks, or are they distributed randomly?
   - Consider factors such as urban planning, accessibility, and community needs.
